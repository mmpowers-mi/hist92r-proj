Entente Allies Establish
Commercial Blockade
of Greece.

WOT.
London,
22.—The rumors last
week that the entente allies had de
termined to compel Greece to repudiate
all hints that she might Interfere with
the passage of allied troops across her
territory have been substantiated by
the inauguration of a pacific blockade.
This measure is expected to elicit an
Immediate declaration from the Greek
government clearly defining its In
tentions.
Some dispatches from Athens go so
far as to say this already has been at
tained' as a result of Earl Kitchener's
conference with King Constantlne, and
that the earl received assurances of a
satisfactory nature. The British gov
ernment, however, has not yet inti
mated that Greece has complied with'
1&e demands of the allies.
i| Greece Feara Germany.
^Greece is described as prey of con
flicting emotions—fear of Germany,
Whose military successes have brought
the Balkan war theater nearer, and her
natural sympathy for the cause of the
allies—dictating opposite paths out of
her-present difficult neutrality. Some
Greek newspapers regard the blockade
of Greece as a violation of interna
tional law.
For the time being military opera
tions in Serbia have been almost sus
pended. This is regarded in England
as an encouraging sign for the Serb
ians and their allies, in view of the fact
that a few daya ago a Bulgarian ad
vance frfom Prllep to Monastir ap
pealed certain.
^Flret Msdleine" For Conatantine.
The informal commercial blockade of
Greece is described as the "first in
stallment of theflrstmediclnethat.esn
cure King Constantino's affliction" by
&e^|**l|.>iall Gazette, which adds:
"W* have seen enough to convince
ntf 4r# can rely on frood falthf In tint
quarter only by exhibiting the punish
ment which awaits guile. The blockade
is a tardy beginning of that process,
to which supplements should be forth
coming without delay."
A E N S IS I E S S E
^ommerelal Blockade Entirely Unex
pected—Opinion Divided.
Paris, Nov. 22.—The declaration of a
commercial blockade of Greece by the
entente powers has produced a marked
impression In Athens, particularly as
it was unexpected.
If
An Athens dispatch to the Petit
Journal says the newspaper organs of
the Greek government accuse the al
lies of attempting to drag Greece into
the. war by harsh measures.
These papers assert Greece has
given sufficient proof that she intends
to maintain the policy of benevolent
neutrality. However, she can not per
mit the transferance of the theater of
war into her own territory. Is is sug
gested that the measures taken by the
allies may result in the withdrawal of
Greek troops from the frontier or even
in partial demobilization.
The section of the press which sup
ports former Premier Venizelos ac
cuses the government of having
brought on by lack of foresight a con
flict with the entente powers.
The general feeling, however, is one
of optimism, and it is believed serious
misunderstanding will be avoided.
Termed Aot of Violence.
Berlin, Nov. 32.—The Overseas News
Agency characterized the commercial
blockade of greece as an "act of
